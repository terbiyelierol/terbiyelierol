#Hi I'm Erol - aka [Full-Stack-Developer][https://www.linkedin.com/in/erolterbiyeli/]ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full-Stack Developer with an extensive background in accounting. I came to Canada 5 years ago in October and continued my accounting career after four years of experience in Canada. I decided to start an entirely new career in Tech as I moved to a new Country. I decided to become a Software Developer. Nowadays, my title is the Student at GA. As a student, I created two different projects, and I will be creating two more projects; you can see my project in my repositories. I have developed a full-stack bookkeeping web application for self-employed and front-end browser base game. 

I like challenges, and I am eager to learn. I believe that writing code and facing the problems in hands-on projects increased my ability to solve the problems.

My passion is to solve the problem since I know myself on the earth. As I continue to solve them in different part of the world

I am currently looking for opportunities in Tech and like to connect with the other devs. 

If you want to reach out to me
